# What will you find here

- **A Country A Movie**: A simple project I made to understand the creation of dashboards in Python. I used a kaggle dataset to retrieve movies information, and then used Bokeh to build an interactive world map retrieving the best scored movie for each country in the world. I also used some HTML and JavaScript to style the live webpage.
- **Simple Algorithms**: Just some algorithms I made for fun, usually problems that I found in books or projects like Euler.
- **SnakePy**: My first Python coding once I learned the language. Just a simple Snake game.
- **ValaPy**: Machine Learning algorithms I made for learning purposes. For example, I build a Linear Regression algorithm from scratch, and then I compare the results of this self-made algorithm with sklearn's algorithm.
